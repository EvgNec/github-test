        <p>This background image can be positioned from the right and
            bottom because it is using a pseudo-element to act as an additional
            background canvas.</p>
        <p>The CSS3 background module allows this but is not yet
            implemented in many browsers. The pseudo-element technique also has the
            added benefit of being able to crop a background image and even position
            it partially, or completely, outside its container.</p>
